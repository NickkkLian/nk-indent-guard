name: nk-indent-guard
description: Stop a one-line edit to a JSON or YAML data file from re-indenting the whole file and burying the real change in a 400-line diff. Use when you edit tracked data files with a script (json.dump, JSON.stringify, a YAML dumper) and before committing them; also use when a diff for a small change looks huge. Compares each file's indentation unit with the last committed version and refuses the commit until the file is written back with the original unit. Not a JSON validator.

# Indent guard

**A rewritten data file passes every validator and destroys the diff.** Change one value, write the file
back with `json.dump(obj, f, indent=1)` on a file that used two spaces: the schema check is green, the
record count is right, the content is right — and the diff is 391 lines instead of 4. Nobody can ever
again answer "what did this commit change". Writing "keep the indent" into a memory did not stop it
happening a third time; a machine check did.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- You just edited a tracked `.json` / `.yaml` / `.yml` file through code and are about to commit.
- A diff for a small edit is suspiciously long.
- You maintain a repository where data files are the product (registries, ledgers, content libraries).

## Procedure

1. After editing, before committing:
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/indent_guard.py` (whole repo) or
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/indent_guard.py data/` (a subtree); `--ref` compares against
   another revision, `--ext` changes the extensions.
2. A red line names the file and the change of unit (`2 spaces → 1 space`, `4 spaces → tab`,
   `2 spaces → none` for pretty → single line). Rewrite the file with the original unit — read it first:
   `references/write-back.md` shows how to detect and preserve the unit in Python and Node.
3. New files have no baseline; they are listed, not judged. Decide their unit deliberately.
4. To make it automatic, install the pre-commit snippet in `references/pre-commit.md` (hooks live in
   `.git/hooks`, so every clone installs it once).

## What it does not do

- It does not validate the content; pair it with your schema check.
- It reads the first 200 lines to find the unit; a file whose first indented line is inconsistent
  with the rest is judged by that first line.
- Key order changes, trailing-newline changes and reformatting inside a line are invisible to it —
  those also inflate diffs, but they are a different guard.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-08: the same mistake three times in one month across two repositories (a devlog
rewritten with `indent=1`, a fix script with `indent=1`, a sources file two weeks later). The guard was
written after the third time. No external source.
